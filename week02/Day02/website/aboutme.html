        <h2>About me</h2>  
        <p>I was born in Brazil on November 22, 1984, I grew up in the city of Brasilia, capital of Brazil, with my family. Since I was a teenager 
            I always liked computers and I had my first contact with programming at 16 years old, that's when I learned HTML.</p>
        <p>In 2003, I started the university of Computer Engineering. In 2008, I finished college and I went to live in Australia to study English,
            and I took the Microsoft certification course, MCPD (Microsoft Certified Professional Developer), so I started
            programming with c#, .NET and met Microsoft Visual Studio.
            I have three years of experience with c#, .NET and sql server development.</p>	
        <p>In 2014, I met my boyfriend at the soccer world cup in Brazil, he's from Switzerland. And in 2016 I moved to Switzerland, where I live today.
            Since I moved to Switzerland I have dedicated myself to learning German, I have the TELC certificate in German level B1.</p>	
        <p>At the moment I have dedicated myself to learn more about web development, I have studied HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, Angular and Dynamics 365.
            In August 2020, I joined the Powercoders program and I'm very excited about Bootcamp, which will take place from September to December 2020.</p>
